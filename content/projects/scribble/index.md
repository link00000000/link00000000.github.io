Scribble is a project created in collaboration with [Patrick Howard](https://phoward.me/).
It is a text editor that allows you to edit your code with syntax highlighting,
and compile and run code, all in the browser. Scribble was built using a
client-server approach where the client and server are completely decoupled and
communicate over a REST API. The server was created with Django and MySQL, the
client was made with VueJS, and the compile server was written in NodeJS.
