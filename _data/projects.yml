      title: Scribble
      desc: Scribble is a project created in collaboration with Patrick Howard. It is a text editor that allows you to edit your code with syntax highlighting, and compile and run code, all in the browser. Scribble was built using a client-server approach where the client and server are completely decoupled and communicate over a REST API. The server was created with Django and MySQL, the client was made with VueJS, and the compile server was written in NodeJS.
